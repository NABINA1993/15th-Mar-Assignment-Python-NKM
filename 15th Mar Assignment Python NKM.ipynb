    "Unsupervised learning can be used for anomaly detection because it can learn the normal patterns and relationships within a dataset without the need for labeled data. Anomalies or outliers are data points that are significantly different from the normal patterns in the dataset. By learning the normal patterns in the dataset, unsupervised learning algorithms can identify the data points that do not fit these patterns.\n",

    "One common unsupervised learning technique used for anomaly detection is clustering. Clustering algorithms group similar data points together based on their distance or similarity to one another. Data points that are significantly different from the other points in the cluster are likely to be anomalies or outliers. For example, if we have a dataset of customer transactions, clustering algorithms can group together transactions with similar patterns of purchase behavior. Any transaction that falls outside of these clusters can be flagged as an anomaly.\n",

    "Another unsupervised learning technique used for anomaly detection is dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction algorithms reduce the number of variables or features in a dataset while retaining as much of the relevant information as possible. Anomalies or outliers can be identified by looking for data points that do not fit the reduced set of features or variables. For example, if we have a dataset of sensor readings from a manufacturing process, dimensionality reduction algorithms can reduce the number of features to only the most relevant ones for detecting faults in the process. Any sensor reading that falls outside of the reduced feature set can be flagged as an anomaly.\n",
